# chess-move-logic

A Python-based program that implements chess move validation and board management using Tkinter for GUI.

## Features

- **Chessboard Setup**: Displays an interactive chessboard with standard initial piece placement.
- **Move Validation**: Implements logic to check the validity of moves for each chess piece based on standard chess rules.
- **GUI Interaction**: Allows users to click on pieces and move them across the board using Tkinter.
- **Custom Features**: Option to expand functionality for additional chess rules (e.g., castling, en passant, pawn promotion).

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for logic implementation.
- **Tkinter**: GUI library for rendering the chessboard and handling user interactions.
